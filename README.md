# Portfolio for developer #2

This project is my personal portfolio, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. During development, I learned and applied **Flexbox**, which helped create a responsive and well-structured layout.

The portfolio includes information about me, links to my social media, and a section showcasing my projects. The website is designed with a focus on minimalism and easy navigation.ðŸš€
